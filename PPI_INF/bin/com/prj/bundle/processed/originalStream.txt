AIMed_d109@1	Crystal structure of the heterodimeric bZIP transcription factor PROTEINT1 PROTEINT2 bind to DNA
AIMed_d109@2	The PROTEINT1 and PROTEINT2 family of eukaryotic transcription factor heterodimerize to form complex capable of binding 5'-TGAGTCA-3 DNA element
AIMed_d109@3	We have determine the X-ray crystal structure of a heterodimer of the bZIP region of PROTEINT1 and PROTEINT2 bind to DNA
AIMed_d109@6	Comparison of the two crystallographically distinct protein-DNA complex show that the coiled-coil be flexibly join to the basic region and that the PROTEINT1 PROTEINT2 heterodimer do not recognize the asymmetric 5'-TGAGTCA-3 recognition element in a unique orientation
AIMed_d219@1	PROTEINT1 negatively regulate PROTEINT2 activity by interaction with the PROTEINT0 cysteine-rich domain
AIMed_d219@1	PROTEINT1 negatively regulate PROTEINT0 activity by interaction with the PROTEINT2 cysteine-rich domain
AIMed_d219@3	We recently report that PROTEINT1 interaction with the PROTEINT0 PROTEINT2 PROTEINT0 residue 139-184 may be require for PROTEINT0 activation
AIMed_d219@3	We recently report that PROTEINT1 interaction with the PROTEINT0 PROTEINT0 PROTEINT2 residue 139-184 may be require for PROTEINT0 activation
AIMed_d219@7	In the present study we demonstrate that PROTEINT1 bind directly to the isolate PROTEINT2
AIMed_d219@8	Moreover mutation of PROTEINT1 residue 143-145 impair binding of 14-3-3 but not PROTEINT2 to the PROTEINT0
